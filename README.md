## üìù Repository Usage

* Each folder contains solved problems along with code and explanations.
* Notes include approaches, pseudocode, time & space complexity, and edge cases.
* Focused on interview patterns and frequently asked questions.

## üîß How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Browse topics or problem categories.
3. Follow the pseudocode and implementations.
4. Try solving problems on your own before checking solutions.
5. Review notes for edge cases and optimization techniques.

## ‚ö° Tips for Interview Prep

* Practice consistently and track your progress.
* Focus on problem patterns rather than memorizing solutions.
* Understand trade-offs in time and space complexity.
* Revise system design, DBMS, OS, and REST API concepts regularly.
* Apply prefix sum, greedy, DP, and graph algorithms to multiple problem types.
